# Interpreting Machine Learning approaches for Early Stage Diabetes prediction
This project predicts early stage diabetes via various machine learning models. The models' perfromances are evaluated by performance metrics and finally XAI models (LIME and SHAP) are used to explain the models' predictions both locally and globally.
